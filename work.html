	For my PhD research, I analyzed data collected by the
	ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  <br> The
	LHC is a circular particle accelerator with a circumference
	of 27km that collides counter-circulating beams of protons
	at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.  <br> ATLAS is one of four
	major experiements located at interaction points around the
	LHC.  <br> Specifically, I was involved in searches for the decay
	of the Standard Model Higgs boson to bottom quarks.  Higgs bosons
	are the tangible evidence for the theory that explains the origin
	of mass in the universe, and were discovered at the LHC in July
	2012. These particles, however, are unstable, meaning that after
	being produced, they quickly decay to more common forms of matter
	(e.g. electrons), and about half of the Higgs bosons that we
	produce are expected to decay to a pair of particles known as
	bottom quarks. <br> My research looked for this dominant decay, which
	is particularly difficult to observe because the particle collisions
	that produce Higgs bosons also produce many orders of magnitude more
	particles which can mimic their decay. <br> We used multivariate and
	statistical techniques to develop a new search for this decay.  Our
	seach targets the vector boson fusion production mechanism in
	association with a photon, and it
	benefits from the large dataset collected by the ATLAS experiment in
	2016. <br> We trained a boosted decision tree using simulated Monte Carlo
	samples to discriminate between signal (i.e. Higgs boson decays)
	and background (everything else) signatures in our detector, and then
	we used a profile likelihood fit to measure the compatibility of
	our observed data with the background only hypothesis. <br> As of 2016, the
	observation of the Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks still remains elusive,
	but we were able to set new limits on how often this process occurs.
