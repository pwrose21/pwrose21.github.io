	Surfing has been a life-long passion of mine.
	I can't remember exactly when I learned, but I was
	young enough that my mom wouldn't let me use a
	surfboard -- so I surfed on my family's boogie
	boards.  Eventually I received hand-me-down surfboards
	from my sister's and brother's friends.  Waves are special.
	I remember waves.  My first wave was bumpy and wild whitewater
	ride.  My board was squirrly.  It swerved right and left while
	I slowly got to one knee and finally up to both feet.  It was late in
	the day.  The sky was dark and the water was darker.  My mom
	and dad and my aunt Joan were watching fom the beach.  It
	wasn't a good wave, but it was my first.  And everyone remembers
	their first.  My brother taught me how to go left and right on waves.  It
	was again late in the day and late in the summer.  In fact, it was the
	last day of summer.  The next day I'd be sitting in class.  I couldn't
	read the waves to know if I should go right or left.  As I paddled for
	each wave, David would yell "RIGHT!" if I need to turn right.  I wasn't
	very good, so when I turned right, I kept turning, and inadvertenly
	pulled out of every wave.  The next summer I had a new board.  It
	was a "RAW Seasoned" surfboard.  When I grew out of it, I'm told,
	Eva, Audrey, and their friends knew it as Peyton's board.  But that
	summer it was still mine.  That summer I caught my first wave where I
	turned right, but managed to stop turning.  It was a small wave -- I
	was small, and the wave was only waist-high on me.  The good thing about
	being small in Virginia Beach is that small waves are okay.  I never
	made it to the open face on that wave, but I did make it down the line.

	Long stretches of small waves and flat oceans demand that surfers in
	Virginia Beach have other ways to get their adrenaline fix.  I started
	skimboarding to pass the time during these flat spells.
